# FRITZBox-SynologyLogCenterDaemon
PHP 7.2 script that records your FRITZ!Box's System Log events in your Synology NAS

Due to a reported bug in FRITZ!OS 6.85 and FRITZ!OS 7.13, the script will record duplicate events in the Log Center database, making this script only useful for AVM models that receive support on FRITZ!OS 7.x
